Finally, we understood the real meaning of 6A3870683E257A397A2675707:
it was a combination of 2696E74396D6B702540255B6D6B and hopefully had
nothing to share with that other @line my Uncle Lou found in a drawer
(Something like 70257472256B766364656626253031323334372675386F6A3870)
Numbers are &dancing around me. 683 (Even 25386F2675386 +Forcefully!)

76637664S7665766376667 is following. Is it going to [end]? Here comes
one more. 66576396B64647665766376667665762675273B7927686A2538397A266.
Big beast. 757667272 Do you really think it is over? Not yet. Wait().
3D7B2420227D613B622 Finally, this should be the last one. Is it? -No?
273B6576616C3B200. Ah! Yes. Now for something completely different:';
