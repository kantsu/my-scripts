Being the one who has given several talks about Japhs, I've decreed
that a Japh uses the following rules:

  - It prints "Just another Perl Hacker" with some reasonable
    capitalization, followed by optional punctuation (comma,
    dot) followed by an optional newline. Some flexibility
    in rules makes for more Japhs. Printing to either STDOUT
    or STDERR is allowed.
  - It doesn't print anything else.
  - The program uses at most 4 lines, each line at most 80 characters.
  - It uses obscure or surprising syntax.
